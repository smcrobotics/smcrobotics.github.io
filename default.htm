    The SMC Robotics Club is a robotics club by and for the students of Santa Monica College. We seek to provide community college students with not only the opportunity to participate in exciting and educational robotics projects, but also to form personal and professional relationships with other likeminded students and aspiring engineers. The club was first founded in the early 2000s, but experienced a recent revival by members Ebony Warren, Carlos **lastname**, and **the other person?**. Though the club is only in its second semester since being reinstated, the members are involved in a plethora of projects; they are participating in the VEX U robotics competition, learning how to use the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Turtlebot3 Burger, using CAD and 3D printers to fabricate custom robot parts, and more.
